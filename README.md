#### Abstract

Noise pollution not only affects people that live in urban settings, but also has a negative impact on natural life, especially on birds, affecting their calls and migrational patterns. The effect of noise pollution on bird populations have been significantly overlooked. Certain species are becoming endangered and have lost what used to be their native habitat. The Sounds of New York City (SONYC) project aims to bring awareness to the problem of noise pollution by deploying a network of acoustic sensors throughout the city to monitor and analyze noise pollution using machine listening. In this project, we focus on using audio recordings collected from the SONYC sensors to understand the effect of noise on birds, by contrasting bird calls with noise patterns near the Washington Square Park region. Understanding patterns of bird calls in comparison to noise levels is an important step towards recognizing the impact that increasing urban activities have on wildlife. Research on these topics can be used to discuss ways of mitigating sound pollution, and to inform new conservational schemes and urban policies to preserve natural life in cities. 

#### Organization of the Code
- The main analysis is carried out in `birds_analysis.ipynb`
- `analysis_yamnet.py` and `utils.py` have auxilary functions
- `tips.ipynb` and `Code_example.py` were used to learn new Python modules and functions
- `BIRDS_compute_data.py` was used by Magdalena to compute the data
- `sonyc_node_info.csv` contains information about the sensors
